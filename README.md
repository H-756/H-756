###***Hello, I'm Hassan!

Welcome to my GitHub profile! As a software engineering enthusiast, I have completed a comprehensive bootcamp that covers various topics in programming and software development. Throughout this program, I gained an in-depth understanding of fundamental programming concepts such as algorithm design, data types, control structures, and functions. Additionally, I was able to delve into more advanced topics such as debugging, defensive programming, and object-oriented programming.

During the program, I also learned how to work with external data sources, manipulate text, and work with databases. I had the opportunity to gain hands-on experience with popular programming tools and technologies such as Git, HTML, CSS, and the Django web framework.

With this strong foundation in software engineering, I am equipped to create programs, build web applications, and work with databases. I remain committed to continuing my practice and building projects that challenge me to further develop my skills.

####**Projects
I am constantly working on new projects, both for personal growth and to enhance my professional portfolio. Here are a few highlights:

*Finacne Calculator:I created a finance calculator program in Python that allows users to choose between two options: an investment calculator or a home loan repayment calculator. The investment calculator computes the amount of interest earned based on the principal amount, interest rate, investment period, and interest type. The home loan repayment calculator computes the monthly repayment amount based on the present value of the house, interest rate, and number of months for repayment. I utilized the math module for power function calculations and incorporated error messages for invalid inputs.

*Task Manager: The objective of this task is for me to create a program for a small business to help manage tasks assigned to each member of the team. The program will work with two text files: user.txt and tasks.txt. I will need to open and modify a template program provided, called task_template.py, to achieve the rest of the compulsory task set out below. The program should allow users to login, register a new user, add a task, view all tasks, and view tasks assigned to them. Additionally, I will need to format the program so that only the user with the username ‘admin’ can register new users and display statistics, such as the total number of tasks and users, in a user-friendly manner.

*Task Manager 2.0: The objective of this task is to modify Task Manager by adding functions for improved modularity. The program should have functions for registering users, adding tasks, viewing all tasks, and viewing tasks assigned to the user. The registration function should not allow duplicate usernames. When viewing tasks assigned to the user, tasks should be displayed with corresponding numbers, and the user should be able to mark tasks as complete or edit tasks if they haven't been completed yet. An option to generate reports should also be added, which will output data to two text files in a user-friendly format. Finally, the menu option for displaying statistics should be modified to read from the generated text files.

*Shoe Inventory Management System: I coded a Python program that reads from the text file inventory.txt and performs various operations on the data to prepare for presentation to my managers. I used a provided template file inventory.py, which has a class named Shoe with attributes such as country, code, product, cost, and quantity. I must define some methods inside this class such as get_cost, get_quantity, and str. I will create a variable with an empty list outside this class that will store a list of shoe objects. The functions where then defined outside the class such as read_shoes_data, capture_shoes, view_all, re_stock, search_shoe, value_per_item, and highest_qty. I then create a menu inside the main that will execute each function above in a while loop.

*Bookstore Database Manegement System: The objective of this project is to create a program for a bookstore clerk that allows them to add, update, delete, and search books in a database called ebookstore. The program should present a menu with options for each function and demonstrate the implementation of database operations covered in the last module. The table in the database should have fields for book ID, title, author, and quantity.
